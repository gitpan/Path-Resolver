=head1 NAME

Path::Resolver::Resolver::AnyDist - find content in any installed CPAN distribution's "ShareDir"

=head1 VERSION

version 3.100451

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $resolver = Path::Resolver::Resolver::AnyDist->new;

  my $simple_entity = $resolver->entity_at('/MyApp-Config/foo/bar.txt');

This resolver looks for files on disk in the shared resource directory of the
distribution named by the first part of the path.  For more information on
sharedirs, see L<File::ShareDir|File::ShareDir>.

This resolver does the
L<Path::Resolver::Role::FileResolver|Path::Resolver::Role::FileResolver> role,
meaning its native type is Path::Resolver::Types::AbsFilePath and it has a
default converter to convert to Path::Resolver::SimpleEntity.
