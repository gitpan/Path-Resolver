=head1 NAME

Path::Resolver::Resolver::Archive::Tar - find content inside a tar archive

=head1 VERSION

version 3.100451

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $resolver = Path::Resolver::Resolver::Archive::Tar->new({
    archive => 'archive-file.tar.gz',
  });

  my $simple_entity = $resolver->entity_at('foo/bar.txt');

This resolver looks for files inside a tar archive or a compressed tar archive.
It uses L<Archive::Tar|Archive::Tar>, and can read any archive understood by
that library.

The native type of this resolver is a class type of
L<Path::Resolver::SimpleEntity|Path::Resolver::SimpleEntity> and it has no
default converter.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 archive

This attribute stores the Archive::Tar object in which content will be
resolved.  A simple string may be passed to the constructor to be used as an
archive filename.

=head2 root

If given, this attribute specifies a root inside the archive under which to
look.  This is useful when dealing with an archive in which all content is
under a common directory.
